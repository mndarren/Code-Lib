# Why Is Life
================================
0. You are not different from me; You are different like me.
1. Your expanded self. 
```
Difference is infinite, but we gravitate towards similarity
Love of the same.
Expanded (+ confidnece and performance, - withdrawal and defensiveness) and diminished self.
Why don't we always show our expanded self? The way to overcoem this is to actively seek out and value other's diverse perspectives.
```
2. Burst the filer bubble
```
Similarity filter => Limits our information
NOT Pay attention to, listen to and value the perspectives => Filter out others
Never shake up our thinking patterns => Holds us back
Invite + Seek + Change
"My door is always open"
"What perspectives am I missing"
"How can I grow"
Caution: May cause discomfort (Overcome negative reaction to difference)
"Put yourself in their shoes"
Ask others
Discuss differences (Share yours and learn others')
Make a plan
```
3. Unwritten rules
```
Take action: 
Model it. 
Encourage others (thank them and tell them the impact). 
Build habits (At the start of a meeting; When seeking input from others; Onboarding a new team member.
```
4. Learn and Practice
```
When we listen and celebrate what is both common and different, we become a wiser, more inclusive and better organization.
