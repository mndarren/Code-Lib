### Design Patterns
===================
1. Singleton
   ```
   1) Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
   2) Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
   3) Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.
